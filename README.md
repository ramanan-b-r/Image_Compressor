# Image Compressor
A simple image compressing tool made using Python, OpenCV and CustomTkinter

# How to use it?
- Store all the images that need to be compressed in a folder. Select this folder when the program asks you to choose the source files.
- Create a destination folder for the compressed images to be stored and choose this when prompted by the program to choose the save location.
- After choosing the source and the destination folder select the quality by dragging the slider.
- Click on the compress button to begin the compression.

# Notes
- The program assumes your images are stored in a folder.
- For best results, start with a quality level of 85 or above. This usually offers a good balance between file size reduction and image preservation. However, the optimal setting may vary based on your specific images and desired quality trade-off.
- Refer to the OpenCV documentation (https://www.opencvhelp.org/tutorials/advanced/image-compression) for further insights into image compression techniques.
